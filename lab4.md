## ITMD 362 Lab 4: Color Palettes

For this lab, you’re going to create several custom color palettes on the site 
Paletton, http://paletton.com. Choose a palette based on each prompt, and paste 
the Paletton URL in with your chosen palette. You’ll see that the uid value in 
the Paletton URL changes with each adjustment that you make. Write 2 sentences 
explaining why you chose the colors you did. Opt for the Paletton Preview mode 
Default with Text; you can start at this URL if you like: 
http://paletton.com/#uid=1000u0kllllaFw0g0qFqFg0w0aF

Create a Basecamp post "Lab-4: your name" and simply post the following as plain text. 

1. An adjacent color palette for introducing a new console gaming platform

Your Palette URL: http://paletton.com/#uid=51t1l0kllll2gu08GuLA+bVUecF

Your Rationale: The reason is, that in gaming, what people don't always realize, they're attracted to the color scheme. For XBox its always been green and gray, while the playstation has been red, yellow and blue. it's the subtle color aesthetics 

2. A triadic color palette for announcing Chicago Botanical Gardens springtime tours.

Your Palette URL: http://paletton.com/#uid=30f1g0kkwnpcgWZiCJMlL8ir72z

Your Rationale: its a warmer palette. the spring time is known for those warmer colors that get you into that vibe that its starting to be warm outside and all those warmer natural colors from nature really start to pop

3. A triadic color palette for styling the login page for a private messaging app

Your Palette URL: http://paletton.com/#uid=33W100kOVaSF4NML9qoXd08++00

Your Rationale: It's on the darker side. Usually when you get into private messaging apps, 90% of the people go "dark mode" anyways. usually having those darker colors goes hand in hand with private messaging apps.

4. A monochromatic color palette for advertising a course on Ruby on Rails

Your Palette URL: http://paletton.com/#uid=100100kpreBcYUrbUIDTA0k++00

Your Rationale: Had to look up "Ruby on Rails". going through their site, it seems they opt for those colors that are a bit bright. For a course I would do, i went a tad darker just to pop out a bit and get those "clicks" on my course since the title would stand out.
